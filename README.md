# **Yalla Hajji Proposal**

### **Introduction**

Yalla Hajji was born from a personal journey and a vision to serve the Ummah. As a software engineer and working professional, I had the privilege of performing Umrah for the first time. While in Makkah, I noticed that many pilgrims preferred to spend every possible moment in the Haram, praying each salah with the Imam, rather than staying in their hotels.

I also observed that many budget-friendly hotels near the Haram ‚Äî which pilgrims truly needed ‚Äî could only be booked offline or through local operators. Many pilgrims still choose to book with **local agents because they know them**. This highlighted a clear gap: pilgrims needed a platform offering both **budget-friendly and full-range packages**, with **complete transparency and reliability**.

After returning home, I began seeing a **recurring dream**: I was in the Haram, struggling to see the Kaaba but unable to reach it. This dream appeared multiple times and became a powerful source of motivation. It reminded me of the challenges pilgrims face and inspired me to dedicate my skills to building a solution.

From this inspiration, **Yalla Hajji was created** ‚Äî a platform that allows pilgrims to **plan their Umrah journey, compare verified packages, and book flights, hotels, and other services in just 10 minutes**. By removing uncertainty and fraud, Yalla Hajji ensures that pilgrims can focus fully on worship, making their sacred journey **safe, transparent, and fulfilling**.

**Key Solutions:**

1. **10-Minute Pilgrim Booking:** Plan and book the entire journey quickly with verified options.
2. **Aggregation of Home-Country Operators:** All operators are verified and listed in one platform, ensuring trust and transparency.

### **The Problem**

Across many countries, Hajj and Umrah pilgrims face serious challenges due to unverified or irresponsible operators:

* **False promises by travel operators** ‚Äì packages advertised as ‚Äúall-inclusive‚Äù (flights, hotels, food, ziyarah) often turn out incomplete.
* **Stranded arrivals** ‚Äì pilgrims left at airports with no pickup.
* **Hotel fraud** ‚Äì bookings not confirmed, pilgrims wait outside hotels with luggage.
* **Advance payment misuse** ‚Äì operators take money 3‚Äì6 months early, then cancel or disappear when costs rise.
* **Visa & ticket fraud** ‚Äì last-minute promises not fulfilled, pilgrims miss travel.
* **Layered middlemen** ‚Äì local agents ‚Üí sub-agents ‚Üí regional brokers ‚Üí licensed Saudi operator. Each layer adds commission, reduces accountability, and increases fraud risk.

> *During my own Umrah, my operator failed to pick us up at the airport. Only Nusuk staff kindly assisted us in reaching the Haram. This personal experience inspired me to build Yalla Hajji to solve these issues.*

### **Our Solution ‚Äì Yalla Hajji Platform**

Yalla Hajji is designed with **two core solutions** that address every major pain point faced by pilgrims:

---

#### **1. Aggregation of Umrah Operators**

* A **single digital marketplace** where all **licensed Umrah operators** are onboarded.
* **Verification first** ‚Äì Operators must submit official documents (agency license, PAN, GST, IATA, or equivalent). Yalla Hajji acts as the **first filter before fraud happens**.
* **Transparency in packages** ‚Äì Operators list complete Umrah packages (flights, hotels, food, ziyarah). Pilgrims can search, compare, and book only verified offers.
* **Authority oversight** ‚Äì With Nusuk integration, officials can monitor operator compliance, pricing, and service delivery.
* **Accountability system** ‚Äì If an operator fails to deliver (no confirmed hotel, no transportation, etc.), Yalla Hajji flags them, removes them from the platform, and reports to authorities.

---

#### **2. Direct Pilgrim Booking System**

For the first time, pilgrims can directly plan and book their Umrah journey online with **full transparency**.

**Features:**

* **Flights** ‚Äì Book flights via IATA-certified partners to ensure legitimate tickets.
* **Hotels** ‚Äì Access budget-friendly 2-star and 3-star hotels near Haram that are **not listed on Booking.com or Agoda** (e.g., *Tarwa Al Munshiya Hotel, Makkah*).
* **Food Options** ‚Äì Organized **home-style food counters** by region (e.g., North Indian, South Indian). Instead of 1,000 operators duplicating cooking arrangements, they share standardized counters ‚Üí authentic food + lower costs.
* **Local Transport & Ziyarah** ‚Äì Pre-book buses, cars, and guided tours with transparent pricing.
* **Booking Tracking System** ‚Äì Pilgrims can verify if their visa, hotel, and flight are truly confirmed before departure.
* **Price Monitoring System** ‚Äì Real-time tracking of flights, hotels, and services to prevent hidden costs.

üìå **Example (Bangalore ‚Üí Jeddah):**

* Flight if booked 3 months early:

  * BLR ‚Üí JED: ‚Çπ25,621 (\~SAR 1,153)
  * JED ‚Üí BLR: ‚Çπ29,850 (\~SAR 1,343)
  * **Round trip:** ‚Çπ55,471 (\~SAR 2,496)
* Balance for hotel + food + transport: **‚Çπ19,529 (\~SAR 879)**

Currently, operators misuse this margin by adding hidden charges or cutting services. Yalla Hajji‚Äôs price tracking ensures **fair and transparent allocation**.

---

### **Why We Require Nusuk**

Local Umrah operators in India appreciate Yalla Hajji but hesitate to fully onboard because the platform is not yet backed by a **recognized authority**.

* By **partnering with Nusuk**, Yalla Hajji gains **instant trust and legitimacy** with operators and pilgrims.
* If Nusuk makes it **mandatory for operators** (especially in India and South Asia) to register on Yalla Hajji, fraudulent players are automatically filtered out.
* With Nusuk‚Äôs authority, Yalla Hajji can scale rapidly and ensure **compliance, fraud prevention, and service excellence**.

We have **personally invested our savings** to build this platform purely to serve pilgrims. With Nusuk‚Äôs support, we can create true impact at scale.

---

### **Priority Roadmap**

1. **Onboard Local Operators** ‚Äì Verified onboarding of all active Umrah operators.
2. **Easy Pilgrim Access** ‚Äì One-stop digital platform for search, compare, and booking.
3. **Expand Services** ‚Äì Integrate food counters, hotels, flights, and transport.
4. **Price Monitoring** ‚Äì Real-time system to protect pilgrims from fraud and hidden costs.

---

### **Expansion Potential**

Yalla Hajji is not limited to India. This model can scale globally ‚Äî onboarding verified operators in multiple countries under one umbrella, ensuring **universal confidence for pilgrims worldwide**.

---

### **Value Proposition**

* **For Pilgrims** ‚Äì Safe, simple, affordable, and transparent Umrah journey, bookable in just 10 minutes.
* **For Operators** ‚Äì Verified recognition, reduced fraud risk, and fair competition.
* **For Authorities (Nusuk & Govt.)** ‚Äì A reliable platform for monitoring, auditing, and ensuring compliance.

### **Conclusion**

Yalla Hajji and Nusuk share the same mission ‚Äî to serve the **Guests of Allah (·∏åuy≈´f al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn)** with transparency and trust.

Together, we can ensure that **millions of pilgrims travel with peace of mind**, focusing only on their worship while Yalla Hajji and Nusuk handle the transparency, safety, and accountability.
